# AndroidLocalCommunicator
A Test Demo for Android local socket communication.

Android os already provide powerful communication methods for IPC. I just want to check if local socket communication is workable.

As showed in Demo, local socket communication works fine, though it requires INTERNET permission.

So it is easy to develop application groups which communicate through local server.

# Todo
I am thinking about developing an social application which based on distributed local server. No idea right now. :D
